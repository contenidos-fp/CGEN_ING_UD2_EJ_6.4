<p>A 48-year-old male patient reports starting 4 months before the consultation with low back pain being medicated with NSAIDs and rest, with little response.<br><br>

It evolves 1 week before the consultation with progressive paraparesis with a predominance of the right, so he consults again after performing CT of the lumbar spine where lithic images are visualized on vertebral bodies, so he is hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment.<br><br>

She enters normal nervous system, lucid and located in time and space, with Deep paraparesis predominantly on the right with a bladder balloon requiring the placement of a foley bladder catheter, patellar and aquilian areflexia, without a sensory level.<br><br>

Laboratory: hematocrit 34%, normal calcium, LDH 718 IU/l, FAL 5350 IU/l. Until the results of the studies were obtained, the patient was medicated with dexamethasone 16 mg/d and gastric protection, which improved paraparesis, persisting with a mild déficit that allowed him to walk with support.<br><br>

MRI of the dorsal and lumbo-sacral spine is requested, showing infiltration of iliac bone and all vertebral bodies, with spinal cord involvement at the level of D12 and L2. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with periaortic adenopathies in the chest and abdomen.<br><br>

A bone marrow puncture biopsy is performed where carcinomatous infiltration is observed, so a search begins to be made for a neoplastic origin of a solid organ, and because there is PSA>100 ng/dL, a prostate biopsy is performed, which reports moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Gleason 7 (4+3).<br><br>

During hospitalization, 2 units of red blood cell paste are transfused because they have hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL.<br><br>

Radiation therapy is indicated to stabilize the spine and avoid spinal cord compression, the total dose of which is completed before discharge.<br><br>

Because of a desire to urinate, the bladder catheter is removed 45 days after admission, but the bladder balloon of mixed obstructive-neurological causes is repeated and the foley bladder tube is replaced.<br><br>

Dexamethasone 8 mg/day VO is rotated, as a reduction plan, with gastric protection with pantoprazole 20 mg/d.<br><br>

Provisional treatment is started with cyproterone 200 mg/d, and leuprolide 7.5 mg IM, and then rotated as definitive treatment with Goserelin 3.6 mg to apply SC every 28 days and Bicalutamide 50 mg/day VO.<br><br>

<b>COMMENT:</b><br><br>

Cancer of unknown primary origin is a common clinical entity and occurs in 2% of all cancer diagnoses.<br><br>

In men with skeletal metastases as the first sign of adenocarcinoma, the most common primary tumors are lung, prostate, and less commonly liver, kidney, thyroid, and colon. Metastatic prostate cancer should be suspected in men with unknown primary adenocarcinoma that predominantly involves bone, especially if the metastases are blastic or sclerotic. Elevated serum levels of PSA or the marking of the tumor with PSA may provide confirmatory evidence of prostate cancer.
